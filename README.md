# Circle-Squaring-Code
Research on Tarski's circle squaring problem done under guidance of Professor Andrew Marks at UCLA.
This code was written to gain intuition about how to decrease the number of pieces required to square the circle.
See talk.pdf for my presentation given at UCLA Undergraduate Research Week 2023 and Women in Math (WIM) Research Night.
